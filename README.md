# DSA210 Project Proposal - Real Estate Price Analysis

## Motivation

The real estate sector is a vital part of the economy and is significantly influenced by factors such as economic trends, social behavior, and government regulations. In recent years, significant fluctuations in real estate prices have been observed, particularly influenced by macroeconomic changes and urban development trends. Analyzing the factors affecting these price changes and predicting future prices can offer valuable insights for investors, policymakers, and real estate professionals.

This project aims to explore the key determinants of housing prices and develop predictive models to forecast future prices.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is a **real-world dataset** collected from [Emlakjet](https://www.emlakjet.com/), a major real estate platform in Turkey. The data was originally compiled and shared on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/egeakyol/real-estate-in-istanbul-turkey-emlakjet), and contains detailed information about listings in Istanbul.

The dataset includes the following features:

- Location (city, district, neighborhood)
- Number of Rooms
- Area (square meters)
- Building Age
- Price
- Floor Information
- Number of Bathrooms

It does not contain any personal or sensitive data and complies with data privacy standards.

## ðŸ› Method and Plan

### Data Collection and Preparation
- Load and explore the real dataset to understand its structure.
- Clean the data: handle missing values, unify formats, drop or impute inconsistencies.
- Create additional features (e.g., numerical room count, grouped building age).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generate descriptive statistics and visualize key features of the data.
- Identify trends and patterns that may influence housing prices.
- Investigate correlations between variables to identify significant predictors.

### Hypothesis Testing
- Perform statistical tests to validate assumptions, including:
  - Is there a correlation between number of rooms and price?
  - Are newer buildings more expensive?
  - Does floor level affect price?

### Modeling Approach (Future Steps)
- Apply machine learning models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Use hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for optimization.

## Ethical Considerations

- The dataset is publicly available and contains no personal identifiers.
- The project adheres to ethical AI practices and responsible data use.
- All tools and models used will be transparently documented.

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations

| Challenge            | Mitigation                                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Quality Issues  | Apply data cleaning and imputation where necessary          |
| Model Bias           | Use validation, avoid overfitting, test on diverse samples  |
| Interpretability     | Include interpretable models and visualizations             |
