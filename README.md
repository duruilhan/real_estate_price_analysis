DSA210 Project Proposal - Real Estate Price Analysis

Motivation
The real estate sector is a vital part of the economy and is significantly influenced by factors such as economic trends, social behavior, and government regulations. In recent years, significant fluctuations in real estate prices have been observed, particularly influenced by macroeconomic changes and urban development trends. Analyzing the factors affecting these price changes and predicting future prices can offer valuable insights for investors, policymakers, and real estate professionals. This project aims to explore the key determinants of housing prices and develop predictive models to forecast future prices.

Data Source
The dataset utilized in this project is collected from Emlakjet, a prominent real estate platform, covering listings between September 19-23, 2023. The dataset comprises approximately 155,000 entries, including critical attributes such as:

- Location (city, district, neighborhood)
- Number of Rooms
- Area (square meters)
- Building Age
- Price
- Type of Property (apartment, detached house, etc.)
- Floor Information
- Number of Bathrooms

The dataset is publicly available and was accessed from reputable online data platforms. Data privacy and ethical considerations were taken into account, ensuring that no personal or sensitive information is included.

METHOD AND PLAN

Data Collection and Preparation
- Conduct initial data exploration to understand structure and identify potential issues.
- Perform data cleaning, including handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming categorical data if necessary.
- Conduct feature engineering to create relevant variables that could enhance the model's performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generate descriptive statistics and visualize key features of the data.
- Identify trends and patterns that may influence housing prices.
- Investigate correlations between variables to identify significant factors.

Modeling Approach (Future Steps)
- Apply various regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Optimize the selected models through hyperparameter tuning.

Ethical Considerations
- The dataset used is publicly available and does not contain personal data.
- The project ensures compliance with data privacy standards.
- AI tools used for analysis will be transparently documented.

Potential Challenges and Mitigations
- Data Quality Issues: Address missing or inconsistent data during the cleaning phase.
- Model Bias: Ensure the model does not overfit and generalizes well to new data by applying cross-validation techniques.
- Ethical Risks: Maintain transparency regarding data sources and modeling processes.

Expected Outcomes
- Identification of key factors influencing real estate prices.
- Development of preliminary insights through statistical analysis and visualizations.
- Foundation for building predictive models to forecast real estate prices.

Progress Update (As of April 18)
We have completed the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and conducted statistical hypothesis testing on the real estate dataset collected from Emlakjet. The following key steps were performed:
- Descriptive statistics and data visualization (price distribution, area-price relationship, average price by number of rooms, etc.)
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between key variables
- Hypothesis testing using Pearson correlation and ANOVA:
- - Number of rooms vs. price
- - Building age vs. price
- - Floor level vs. price
These analyses provide valuable insights into which features significantly influence housing prices, and they form the foundation for upcoming machine learning modeling.

Future Steps
- Apply machine learning models to develop price prediction models.
- Evaluate and refine the models based on performance metrics.
- Prepare comprehensive reporting and visual presentations for final submission.

This project is expected to provide valuable insights into the real estate market trends and serve as a foundation for developing predictive models. The findings can support stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding property investments.
